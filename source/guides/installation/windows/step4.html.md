# Install language tools

SplashKit works with a number of programming languages. Each of these has its own set of tools you will need to install.

* For C#, install the [Dotnet core](/guides/installation/windows/dotnet/install.html) tools.
* For C++, install [g++](/guides/installation/windows/clang.html) in MSYS2.
