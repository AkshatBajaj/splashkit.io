# SplashKit Website

Website for SplashKit SDK, hosted via GitHub pages

## Getting started

Start by ensuring you have ruby on your system. You may want to install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to keep your ruby versions under control. Refer to rbenv's [installation guide](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) on how to do so.

Then, install [bundler](http://bundler.io) to sort out your ruby dependencies:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

## Developing

Develop using:

```bash
$ bundle exec middleman
```
